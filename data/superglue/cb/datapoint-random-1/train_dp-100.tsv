Uh, but I'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools. But then, again, I'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put. Uh, because the dropout rate is, in those areas, w-, it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime. And they all seem to go together. And it seems like if you could eliminate one of the parts of that circle, where you have the dropout rate and crime and, you know, general poverty kind of conditions, that things ought to get better.

230	230	A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied.

B: Yeah. A: Um, looking back, like maybe some of the things that I know now, I'm not sure I do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives.

114	114	The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef...
