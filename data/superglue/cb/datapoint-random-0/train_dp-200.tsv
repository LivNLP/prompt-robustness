B: Uh-huh. A: And I haven't quite figured that out, if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or, uh, uh, if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing.	they have got it won	neutral	126
179	179	B: Oh, I see. A: um, and I think I'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school, because I think their parents pay more, and I think the kids are a little bit more challenged, because their parents are probably college educated, where at the public school, I don't think as many parents are college educated,	as many parents are college educated at the public school	contradiction	179

242	242	The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some communities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents.  But, despite the recent softening, for many of these retailers there's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s, when their leases were signed.

27	27	But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad.
